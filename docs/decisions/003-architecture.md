# Selecting collaboration sofwtare

## Context and Problem Statement

As we are working on the project in groups we need a software that will allow us to seemlessly collaborate and work on the most up to date version of the project.

Outside users may want to view our project so they need a system that will allow us to merge all our changes into one place.

## Considered Options

* GitHub
* Codeberg

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: GitHub, because
it is the software the group is the most familar with. It also allows branching so we can all work on our own areas on the project and then merge them into the origin to allow us to pull the most up to date version of the project.

### Consequences

* Good, because allows collaboration, allows us to branch and work on our own part of the project without affecting an area someone else may be working on
* Bad, because merge conflicts can be difficult to resolve

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### GitHub

* Good, allows collaboration
* Good, because allows us to branch and work on our own part of the project without affecting an area someone else may be working on
* Bad, merge conflicts can be difficult to resolve

### Codeberg

* Good, because open sourced and community driven
* Good, because allows collaboration
* Bad, because documenation is not detailed so if unfamilar with the system may take more time to get to grips with it
